  <h3>Nikolai's friends considered his first question. Then Sonya, the heron, spoke. "To know the best time to do things, one must plan in advance," she said.</h3>
  <h3>Gogol, the monkey, who had been rooting through some leaves to find something good to eat, said, "you wil know when to do things if you watch and pay close attention."</h3>
  <h3>Then Puskin, the dog, who was just dozing off, rolled over and said, "You can't pay attention to everything yourself. You need a pack to keep watch and help you decide when to do things. For example, Gogol, a coconut is about to fall on your head!"</h3>

    <h3>Nikolai thought for a moment. Then he asked his second question."Who is the most important one?"</h3>
</div>
<!-- ///////page 6 - Animals 3 pane, monkey rubbing head//////// -->
<div class="page6-wrapper">
    <h3>"Those that are closest to heaven," said Sonya, circling up into the sky.</h3>
    <h3>"Those who know how to heal the sick," said Gogol, stroking his bruised noggin.</h3>
    <h3>"Those who make the rules," growled Puskin.</h3>

<div class="page7-wrapper">
    <h3>Nikolai thought some more. Then asked the third question. "What is the right thing to do?"</h3> <h3>"Flying," said Sonya.</h3><h3>"Having fun all the time," laughed Gogol.</h3> <h3>"Fighting," barked Puskin right away.</h3>

    <h3>Then the  boy thought for a long while. He loved his friends. He knew they were all trying their best to help him answer his questions. But their answers didn't seem quite right. </h3>
    <h3>Then, an idea came to him. I know! he thought. I will ask Leo, the turtle. He has lived a very long time. Surely he will know the answers I am looking for. </h3>

    <h3>Nikolai hiked high up into the mountains where the old turtle lived all alone.</h3>

<!-- ////////////page 10 - Turtle digging//////////// -->
<div class="page10-wrapper">
    <h3>When Nikolai arrived, he found Leo digging a garden. The turtle was old, and digging was hard for him.</h3>
    <h3>"I have three questions and I came to ask your help," Nikolai said.</h3>
    <h3>"When is the best time to do things? Who is the most inportant one? What is the right thing to do?"</h3>
</div>

<!-- ////////////page 11 - Nikolia digging//////////// -->
<div class="page11-wrapper">
    <h3>Leo listened carefully, but he only smiled. Then went on with his digging.</h3>
    <h3>"You must be tired," Nikolai said at last. "Let me help you." The turtle gave him his shovel and thanked him.</h3>
    <h3>And because it was easier for a young boy to dig than it was for an old turtle, Nikolai kept on digging until the rows were finished.</h3>
</div>

<!-- ////////////page 12 - Nikolia with shovel in rain//////////// -->
<div class="page12-wrapper">
    <h3>But just as he finished, the wind blew wildly and rain burst from the darkened clouds.</h3>
    <h3>As they moved towards the cottage for shelter, Nikolai suddenly heard a cry for help.</h3>

    <h3>Running down the path, he found a panda whose leg had been injured by a fallen tree.</h3>

    <h3>Carefully, Nikolai carried her into Leo's house and made a splint for her leg with a stick of bamboo.</h3>

<div class="page15-wrapper">
    <h3>The storm raged on, banging at the doors and windows.</h3>

<div class="page16-wrapper">
    <h3>The boy ran out of the cottage and down the path. The roar of the storm was deafening. Pushing against the howling wind and drenching rain, he ran farther into the forrest. There he found the panda's child, cold and shivering on the ground.</h3>

<!-- ////////////page 17 - Panda's in bed//////////// -->

    <h3>The little panda was wet and scared, but alive. Nikolai carried her inside and made her warm and dry. Then he laid her in her mother's arms.</h3>

    <h3>The next morning the sun was arm, birds sang, and all was well with the world. The panda's leg was healing nicely, and she thanks=ed Nikolai for saving her and her baby from the storm.</h3>
    <h3>At that moment, Sonya, Gogol, and Puskin arrived to make sure everyone was all right.</h3>

<div class="page20-wrapper">
    <h3>Nikolai felt great peace within himself. He had wonderful friends. And he had saved the panda and her child. But he also felt disappointed. He still had not found the answers to his three questions. So he asked Leo one more time.</h3>
    <h3>The old turtle looked at the boy. "But your questions have been answered!" he said. "They have?" asked the boy.</h3>

    <h3>"Yesterday, if you had not stayed to help me dig my garden, you would not have heard the panda's cries for help in the storm. Therefore, the most important time was the time you spent digging the garden. The most important one at that moment was me, and the most important thing to do was to help me with my garden."</h3>
    <h3>"Later, when you found the injured panda, the most important time was the time you spent mending her leg and saving her child. The most important ones were the panda and her baby. And the most important thing to do was to take care of them and make them safe."</h3>
